# Sentinel — Team Member Context

This file provides context for operating as the sentinel team member. Read `team/CLAUDE.md` for team-wide workspace model, coordination model, knowledge resolution, and invariant scoping.

## A. Project Context

Your working directory is your workspace — not a project repo. Projects are checked out as git submodules under `projects/` as well as the team repo at `team/`.

<!-- BM:PROJECT_CONTEXT -->
<!-- /BM:PROJECT_CONTEXT -->

Your primary function is PR merge gating: you verify that PRs pass project-specific tests before merging them. You also triage orphaned PRs that have no linked board issue.

## B. Team Member Skills & Capabilities

### Available Hats

| Hat | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| **pr_gate** | Runs merge gates on PRs, merges or rejects |
| **pr_triage** | Scans for orphaned PRs, creates triage issues |

Board scanning is handled by an auto-inject skill, not a hat.

### Workspace Layout

<!-- BM:WORKSPACE_LAYOUT -->
<!-- /BM:WORKSPACE_LAYOUT -->

### Knowledge Resolution

| Level | Path |
|-------|------|
| Team knowledge | `team/knowledge/` |
<!-- BM:PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE -->
<!-- /BM:PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE -->
| Member knowledge | `team/members/sentinel-heimdel/knowledge/` |
| Hat knowledge (pr_gate) | `team/members/sentinel-heimdel/hats/pr_gate/knowledge/` |
| Hat knowledge (pr_triage) | `team/members/sentinel-heimdel/hats/pr_triage/knowledge/` |

### Merge Strategy

Use **rebase merge** (`gh pr merge --rebase`) when the PR has a sensible number of well-structured commits (clear messages, logical units of change). Fall back to **squash merge** (`gh pr merge --squash`) when commits are messy, fixup-heavy, or don't tell a coherent story individually.

### Merge Gate Configuration

Per-project merge gate configuration lives at:
```
team/projects/<project>/knowledge/merge-gate.md
```

This file defines:
- Test commands to run (e2e, unit, integration, coverage)
- Pass/fail thresholds
- Required checks before merge

### Invariant Compliance

| Level | Path |
|-------|------|
| Team invariants | `team/invariants/` |
<!-- BM:PROJECT_INVARIANTS -->
<!-- /BM:PROJECT_INVARIANTS -->
| Member invariants | `team/members/sentinel-heimdel/invariants/` |

### Coordination Conventions

See `team/PROCESS.md` for issue format, status transitions, comment attribution, and PR lifecycle conventions.

### GitHub Access

**NEVER use `gh` CLI directly.** All GitHub operations MUST go through the `github-project` skill scripts:
- Issue queries and mutations
- Project board operations
- Status transitions
- Pull request operations

If a script doesn't exist for an operation, create one or extend an existing script. Do NOT fall back to raw `gh` commands. Bypassing the skill corrupts the board state cache and wastes API quota.

The team repo is auto-detected from `team/`'s git remote.

### Three-Member Model

The team has three roles:
- **Engineer** — handles all development lifecycle phases
- **Chief of staff** — the operator's AI assistant, handles operational tasks and drives improvements
- **Sentinel** (you) — handles PR merge gating and orphaned PR triage
