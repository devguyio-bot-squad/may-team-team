# Board Scanner (Sentinel Scope)

This skill defines your PLAN step when coordinating. Scan the GitHub
Projects v2 board for `snt:*` statuses and project fork PRs, then
DELEGATE by publishing exactly one event to the appropriate hat.

## Scan Procedure

### 1. Scratchpad

Append a new scan section to the scratchpad with the current timestamp.
Delete `tasks.jsonl` if it exists to prevent state bleed from previous
hat activations.

### 2. Sync workspace

```bash
git -C team pull --ff-only 2>/dev/null || true
```

### 3. Fetch the board

Load the `github-project` skill and use its **board-view** operation to fetch
all project items with their Status field values. The board-view operation
handles repo detection, project ID caching, and item retrieval internally.

Use the results to identify each item's issue number and current status
for dispatch. Filter for items with Status field values starting with `snt:`.

### 4. Reconcile (if needed)

If ANY items from the board fetch have null or empty status, run the
`github-project` skill's **status-reconcile** operation before proceeding:

```bash
bash scripts/status-reconcile.sh
```

Then re-fetch the board (repeat step 3) to get the corrected statuses.

**Why this happens:** The Status field is a `ProjectV2SingleSelectField` where
each option has an internal ID. Editing the field in the GitHub Projects UI
(reorder, color change, add/remove option) regenerates all option IDs. Items
referencing old IDs lose their status. The reconciliation script recovers each
item's last status from GitHub's timeline API and re-applies it with fresh IDs.

Log the event to poll-log.txt:
```
2026-05-17T10:15:01Z — board.scan — RECONCILE — N items had null status, reconciliation applied
```

### 5. Log to poll-log.txt

Use `$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)` for all timestamps.

```
2026-03-02T10:15:00Z — board.scan — START
2026-03-02T10:15:01Z — board.scan — 1 snt issues found, 0 orphaned PRs
2026-03-02T10:15:01Z — board.scan — END
```

### 6. Dispatch

Dispatch based on the highest-priority work found. Process one item at a time.

**Priority (highest first):**

| # | Status / Condition | Event |
|---|--------|-------|
| 1 | `snt:gate:merge` | `snt.gate` |
| 2 | Orphaned PRs detected on project forks | `snt.triage` |

No sentinel work found → emit `LOOP_COMPLETE`.

### 6. Periodic PR Triage

Every 10th scan cycle (or when no `snt:gate:merge` items are found), also
scan open PRs on all configured project forks for orphaned PRs. If found,
dispatch `snt.triage`.

## Idempotency

Before dispatching, verify the issue is not already at the target output
status. If it is, skip it and check the next issue.

Include the issue number in the published event context so downstream hats
know which issue to work on.

## Failed Processing Escalation

Before dispatching, count comments matching `Processing failed:` on the issue.

- Count < 3 → dispatch normally.
- Count >= 3 → use the `github-project` skill's **status-transition** operation
  to set the issue's project status to `error`, skip dispatch, use the
  **add-comment** operation to post:
  `"Issue #N failed 3 times: [last error]. Status set to error. Please investigate."`
  If RObot is enabled, also send a `ralph tools interact progress` notification.

Skip items with Status `error` during dispatch.

## Error Handling

If any `github-project` skill operation fails during the scan:

1. Log the error to `errors-log.txt` with the full command and output.
2. If the failure is on a specific issue (status-transition, add-comment), skip
   that issue and continue scanning the rest.
3. If the failure is systemic (project not found, auth failure), emit
   `LOOP_COMPLETE` and log the reason.

## Comment Format

All board scanner comments use:

```
### 🛡️ sentinel — $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
```

## Rules

- ALWAYS log to poll-log.txt before publishing.
- Publish exactly ONE event per scan cycle to dispatch work.
- When no work is found, emit `LOOP_COMPLETE`.
- NEVER merge a PR without running the project's merge-gate tests first.
